# Agent TODO (auto-maintained)

- Improve ingestion to detect multi-table Excel layouts (pack headers + item blocks) and capture pack meta (gem totals, value notes).
- Add price inference (pack name hints + gem total to USD conversion) and capture per-item gem-per-unit values.
- Expand config with pack price hints and valuation parameters; update tests for new logic.
- Document game mechanics, valuation strategy, image handling; refresh AI guide and data model.
- Run pipeline on real Excel data, update site_data exports, ensure logs/tests are clean; commit and push.
